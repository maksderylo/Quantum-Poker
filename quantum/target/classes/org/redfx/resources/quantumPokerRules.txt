Quantum Poker is a game relative to Texas holdem, but instead of cards there are, you guessed it, QUBITS! (and quantum gates).

1. Game Logic

All the game logic is the same as the texas holdem so in order to undersand them go there, here you can focus on the computing the score using quantum computing.

2. QUBITS

Instead of cards, the table all the players share has qubits. In order to undersand them you can think of them as bits (either 0 or a 1),
but qubits have a probability to be 0 or a 1 upon measuring. The qubits in the beginning can have 4 states:

|0> - 100% to be a 0.
|+> - 50% to be a 0, 50% to be a 1.
|-> - 50% to be a 0, 50% to be a 1.
|1> - 100% to be a 1.
(the difference between |+> and |-> qubit is thet they are achieved after applying Hadamard gate to different starting qubits)

The table just like in standard poker is dealt eventually 5 times. 3 qubits for the flop, and one for both the turn and the river.
It is important that the first qubits are the most important, because the scoring is dependent on a binary number they create.

3. Gates

Players instead of cards are dealt quantum gates. In our simple game player can only recieve 3 types of gates: Pauli-X Gate - letter N,
Hadamard gate - letter H and Controlled Not-Gate - letter C. There are many good resources to find out in depth what those gates do,
but below you can find what each gate does to a qubit.

Pauli-X Gate - letter N
|0> -> |1>
|+> -> |->
|-> -> |+>
|1> -> |0>


Hadamard gate - letter H
|0> -> |+>
|+> -> |0>
|-> -> |1>
|1> -> |->

Controlled Not-Gate - letter C
This gate is more complicated, because it entangles two qubits!
To simply put it, it is acted on two qubits - control and target qubit. The rule is:
If control qubit is measured as 0 nothing happens.
If control qubit is measured as 1 the target qubit is flipped.

4. The score

Each players score is computed after the players apply their gates to the sets of qubits and clicks proceed.
At that time the qubits are measured and reveal a binary number! So for example if the measured qubits give 00110 the score is 6.
The higher the score the better, and the players with the same score if they win they split the money.
